## Introduction
* Koroibos is a Ruby on Rails application that provides endpoints for a user to query for information about competitors in the 2016 Summer Olympics.  The application uses olympics data that is imported from a CSV file into the database.  ActiveRecord is used to query the database, based on the information needed for each API endpoint.

* The production app is located at https://rocky-refuge-05265.herokuapp.com/

## Initial Setup
1. Clone this repository.
1. Once it has been cloned, run `bundle`.  
1. After bundling, run `rake db:{create,migrate}`.  
1. Seed the database by running `rake import:data`.

## How to Use
* There are several endpoints in this project.  The first endpoint is used to obtain all of the olympians.  The user makes a GET request to `/api/v1/olympians`.  The response includes all of the competing olympians, including data about their name, team, age, sport and total medals won.  Below is a sample of the response:

## Known Issues
* None at this time.

## Running Tests
* The application was created with RSpec.  To run the test suite, enter `rspec` from the command line.
